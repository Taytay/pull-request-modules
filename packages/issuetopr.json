BUT it does so by changing the issue INTO the pull request, thus making it disappear from the issues list.\n\nIf that is not an issue for you, by all means, please use it.\n\n## Getting started\n\nInstall it by running `npm i issuetopr -g`\n\nIf you don't have npm's bin directory in your path, please add it or symlink issuetopr like so:\n`ln -s /usr/local/share/npm/bin/issuetopr <dir_in_your_path>/issuetopr`\n\nIn order access the github API on your behalf, you must provide an access token.\n\nYou can generate the token at https://github.com/settings/applications by clicking the 'Generate new token' button in the 'Personal access tokens' section.\n\nIt is recommended that you store the token in your global config file by creating `$HOME/.issuetoprrc` with the following config:\n`user=<my_new_github_token>`\n\nOnce you have done that, you should be able to simply run `issuetopr <issue#>` to create a pull request from an existing issue.\n\n*See performance caveats below for reasons you may want to do a bit of configuring beyond the above.*\n\n## Configuration\n\nissuetopr is largely capable of self-configuring at run time, but at a performance cost.\n\nIn order to ensure best performance\n\n- add a `base=<my_global_default_merge_branch>` setting to your global config\n- run `issuetopr init` in your projects' root dirs to create per-project configs\n\nYou can configure issuetopr globally, per project, and at run time.\n\n### global config\n\nCreate .issuetoprrc in your $HOME directory as mentioned above.\n\n### in a project\n\nThis is most useful for setting the repo path and/or base branch defaults.\n\nCreate `<my_project_dir>/.issuetoprrc` by running `issuetopr init`:\n\nFor example, for issuetopr itself:\n```\n    repo=aaronmccall/issuetopr\n    base=master\n```\n\n\n### at run time\n\n`issuetopr <issue#> --repo=<account>/<repo> --base=<merge_to> --head=<merge_from>`\n","created":"2014-08-13T00:21:34.451Z","modified":"2014-08-14T22:22:09.469Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"aaronmccall","email":"aaron@andyet.net"},"owners":[{"name":"aaronmccall","email":"aaron@andyet.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"issuetopr","_npmUser":{"name":"aaronmccall","email":"aaron@andyet.net"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.21","_rev":"1-ae0f7fdaaaefcbbcdf5120532419e0f7","author":{"name":"Aaron McCall","email":"aaron@andyet.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/aaronmccall/issuetopr/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.4.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"e896baf0feb964e900502ec0b221a66894bfb8bf","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/issuetopr/-/issuetopr-1.4.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"aaronmccall","email":"aaron@andyet.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-08-14T22:22:09.469Z","created":"2014-08-13T00:21:34.451Z","1.0.0":"2014-08-13T00:21:34.451Z","1.0.1":"2014-08-13T00:46:24.318Z","1.1.0":"2014-08-13T01:15:58.837Z","1.3.0":"2014-08-13T21:05:32.258Z","1.4.0":"2014-08-14T22:22:09.469Z"}}}
