Here is a sample one:\n``` json\n{\n    /* these denote 'sections' of your repo */\n    \"sections\": [\n        {\n            /*\n             * so either bobby or billy can be used as reviewers for \n             * code that is in the 'API' section of the repo\n             */\n            \"key\": \"API\",\n            \"groupSlug\": \"stash-group-slug-api\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"key\": \"UI\",\n            \"groupSlug\": \"stash-group-slug-ui\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"key\": \"QA\",\n            \"groupSlug\": \"stash-group-slug-qa\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"parseBranchRegex\": \"TICK-\\d\\d\\d\\d\", /* regex to auto-determine the ticket number */\n    \"projectKey\": \"FOOB\",\n    \"slug\": \"repo1\" /* repo slug. should be the same as the repo name */\n}\n```\nFor each \"groupSlug\" specified in the .creview-config file, you will need a Stash group by that name.  It should contain all of the users that could possibly perform a review for that type of pull request.\n\n## Usage\n```\ncreview --help # get help to see all documentation\ncd path/to/repo\ncd even/deeper # it doesn't matter, where you are in the repo. We'll find the root for you :)\ncreview -t TICK-1234 -m \"Im making a pull request.\" -s UI # make a pull request that involves only UI code changes\n```\n\n## Notes\n- this only supports up to 1000 users per group. We could add support for more, but I didn't feel like dealing with paging api's right now.\n- the \"-s\" and \"--sections\" parameters are no longer required.\n- the `STASH_CREVIEW_STATIC_REVIEWERS` env var will limit your random reviewers. A static reviewer CANNOT be one of the randomly selected reviewers.\n- the parseBranchRegex .creview-config value will always be run in a case-insensitive context, and only return the first match ","created":"2015-03-24T16:04:19.901Z","modified":"2015-04-07T17:53:10.522Z","lastPublisher":{},"owners":[{"name":"ingshtrom","email":"ingshtrom.developer@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"stash-creview","_nodeVersion":"0.12.1","_npmUser":{},"_npmVersion":"2.7.3","_rev":"1-2d7ef82ee1482800e0051d38a0092a69","_shasum":"cd09e4cb63274b97c6c00ae8f9dcf7f85becc544","author":{"name":"Alex \"Ingshtrom\" Hokanson","email":"ingshtrom.developer@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ingshtrom/stash-creview/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"init":"1.0.0","latest":"1.2.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"cd09e4cb63274b97c6c00ae8f9dcf7f85becc544","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/stash-creview/-/stash-creview-1.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ingshtrom","email":"ingshtrom.developer@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-04-07T17:53:10.522Z","created":"2015-03-24T16:04:19.901Z","1.0.0":"2015-03-24T16:04:19.901Z","1.0.1":"2015-03-24T20:20:03.776Z","1.0.2":"2015-03-26T13:05:33.348Z","1.0.3":"2015-03-26T16:23:25.020Z","1.0.4":"2015-03-26T16:30:35.633Z","1.2.0":"2015-04-07T17:26:12.492Z","1.2.1":"2015-04-07T17:53:10.522Z"}}}
