This must include a `repository` property with the path to the project's git repository on GitLab. Please see npm's documentation on the [format of the repository field](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#repository<Paste>). The repository field is parsed by [git-pkg-repo](get-pkg-repo), supporting many formats, including HTTPS and SSH.\n\n### options\n\n`options` is an object with the following properties:\n\n* `debug`\n* `scmToken`\n\n#### debug\n**Default:** _false_\n\nSet to `true` to enable debug mode. In debug mode all input will be validated, but no comments will be posted to GitLab.\n\nThis serves a different purpose than the _[Debugging](#debugging)_ section; which simply prints debug messages to the console.\n\n#### scmToken\n\nAn authentication token with access to the to-be-released project so that comments can be posted to the project's issues.\n\n**Authentication Requirements**\n\nThe account associated with the authentication token must have _Guest_ permissions on the project so that this plugin may use the _Leave comments_ action, as documented on the [GitLab Permissions](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/permissions.html) site.\n\n### data\n\n`data` is an object with the following property:\n\n* `commits`\n* `version`\n\n#### commits\n\nAn array containing each commit's commit message in the form of a string.\n\n#### version\n\nA string, that's a valid semantic version, representing the version that's been released.\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\nvar gitlabNotifier = require('semantic-release-gitlab-notifier');\n\nvar config = {};\n\ngitlabNotifier(config)\n\t.then(function () { /* Commentssuccessfully created on GitLab */ })\n\t.catch(function () { /* Do any exception handling here */ });\n```\n\n## Debugging\n\nTo assist users of the `semantic-release-gitlab-notifier` plugin with debugging the behavior of this module we use the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) utility package to print information about the release process to the console. To enable debug message printing, the environment variable `DEBUG`, which is the variable used by the `debug` package, must be set to a value configured by the package containing the debug messages to be printed.\n\nTo print debug messages on a unix system set the environment variable `DEBUG` with the name of this package prior to executing a tool that invokes this plugin:\n\n```bash\nDEBUG=semantic-release-gitlab-notifier [RELEASE TOOL]\n```\n\nOn the Windows command line you may do:\n\n```bash\nset DEBUG=semantic-release-gitlab-notifier\n[RELEASE TOOL]\n```\n\nAll `semantic-release-gitlab` plugins use `debug` to print information to the console. You can instruct all plugins, and `semantic-release-gitlab`, to print their debug information by using `semantic-release-gitlab*` as the value of the `DEBUG` environment variable.\n\n```bash\nDEBUG=semantic-release-gitlab* [RELEASE TOOL]\n```\n\nYou may also print debug messages for the underlying HTTP request library, [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request), by setting the `NODE_DEBUG` environment variable to `request`, as [shown in their documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request#debugging).\n\nAs an example:\n\n```bash\nNODE_DEBUG=request [RELEASE TOOL]\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read our [contributing](https://gitlab.com/hyper-expanse/semantic-release-gitlab-notifier/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide on how you can help improve this project.\n","created":"2016-08-02T02:21:17.759Z","modified":"2017-03-12T23:57:03.071Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"hbetts","email":"hutson@hyper-expanse.net"},"owners":[{"name":"hbetts","email":"hutson@hyper-expanse.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"semantic-release-gitlab-notifier","_nodeVersion":"6.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/semantic-release-gitlab-notifier-5.0.4.tgz_1489363021051_0.40637901914305985"},"_npmUser":{"name":"hbetts","email":"hutson@hyper-expanse.net"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"13-8c6254def3b7a7c86be5aad9419f5226","_shasum":"2ff1499d2daee576b7480ab16fc178626e43392f","author":{"name":"Hutson Betts","email":"hutson@hyper-expanse.net","url":"https://gitlab.com/hutson"},"bugs":{"url":"https://gitlab.com/hyper-expanse/semantic-release-gitlab-notifier/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"5.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"2ff1499d2daee576b7480ab16fc178626e43392f","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/semantic-release-gitlab-notifier/-/semantic-release-gitlab-notifier-5.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"hbetts","email":"hutson@hyper-expanse.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-12T23:57:03.071Z","created":"2016-08-02T02:21:17.759Z","1.0.0":"2016-08-02T02:21:17.759Z","2.0.0":"2016-08-08T02:53:01.045Z","3.0.0":"2016-08-08T04:11:02.248Z","3.1.0":"2016-08-20T04:01:31.678Z","3.1.1":"2016-08-20T22:02:03.328Z","3.1.2":"2016-08-20T22:24:45.792Z","3.1.3":"2016-08-20T22:55:28.829Z","3.1.4":"2016-08-20T23:36:57.659Z","3.1.5":"2016-08-21T00:03:26.896Z","3.1.6":"2016-08-25T03:33:28.722Z","3.1.7":"2016-08-25T13:42:03.432Z","3.1.8":"2016-08-26T03:12:11.079Z","3.1.9":"2016-08-27T04:01:17.666Z","3.1.10":"2016-08-27T20:15:32.219Z","3.1.11":"2016-09-02T03:16:05.938Z","3.1.12":"2016-09-06T02:34:07.904Z","3.1.13":"2016-09-08T13:29:28.593Z","3.1.14":"2016-09-22T07:08:20.590Z","3.1.15":"2016-10-03T02:17:13.785Z","3.1.16":"2016-10-17T03:42:04.964Z","3.1.17":"2016-10-28T05:06:36.042Z","3.1.18":"2016-11-12T18:24:43.155Z","3.1.19":"2016-11-12T20:17:19.183Z","3.1.20":"2016-11-20T15:54:41.174Z","3.1.21":"2016-12-04T00:10:36.011Z","3.1.22":"2017-01-12T03:47:35.918Z","4.0.0":"2017-01-22T04:06:19.413Z","5.0.0":"2017-02-05T00:38:14.223Z","5.0.1":"2017-02-06T03:15:11.183Z","5.0.2":"2017-02-13T03:34:23.118Z","5.0.3":"2017-02-15T04:22:38.477Z","5.0.4":"2017-03-12T23:57:03.071Z"}}}
