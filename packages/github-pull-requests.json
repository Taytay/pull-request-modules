Works on the client or server side.\n\n## How it works\n\nWe query the GitHub API v3 for the full list of available events triggered by the specified user (probably won't reach back further than several months). Each time a pull request **initiated by this user** is referenced, we store that reference. Then we filter out duplicates and finally re-fetch updated information before resolving the Promise with the list of pull requests.\n\n### Install\n\n```\nnpm install github-pull-requests\n```\n\n### API:\n\n`getPullRequests (username[, state[, authOptions]])`\n\n* `username`: any valid GitHub username\n* `state` (optional): filters results - \"all\" (default), \"opened\", \"closed\" or \"merged\" (subset of \"closed\")\n* `authOptions` (optional): options hash containing OAuth2 credentials (see [Auth](#auth) below).\n\n### Usage:\n\n```\nvar getPullRequests = require('github-pull-requests');\n\ngetPullRequests('someuser', 'merged')\n  .then(pullRequests => pullRequests.map(pr => pr.url))\n  .then(urls => console.log(urls));\n```\n\n#### Prints:\n\n```\n> Ending query early due to GitHub API fetch limits.\n[ 'https://api.github.com/repos/FooWorks/foo-works/pulls/20',\n  'https://api.github.com/repos/BarSoft/bar-soft/pulls/492' ]\n```\n\n### Auth\n\nIf you plan to use this function at least a few times per hour, you will *need* to supply some form of GitHub OAuth with your request: either an OAuth2 token ([obtained via user-side authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#web-application-flow)), or a client ID and secret, which you can obtain by [registering a new OAuth application on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) (only safe for server-side auth).\n\nThese parameters can be passed into `getPullRequests` as keys in an object, passed as a third argument to the function.\n\nE.g.\n\n```\ngetPullRequests('someuser', 'all', { oAuthToken: 'OAUTH-TOKEN' })\n  .then(/* ... handle data */);\n```\n\nor\n\n```\ngetPullRequests('someuser', 'all', {\n  clientId: 'CLIENT-ID',\n  clientSecret: 'CLIENT-SECRET'\n}).then(/* ... handle data */);\n```\n\n## Promises\n\nThis module assumes your environment already supports Promises. If you need a polyfill, try [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise).\n","created":"2016-08-29T19:51:11.529Z","modified":"2016-08-30T17:06:23.572Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"benwiley4000","email":"therealbenwiley@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"benwiley4000","email":"therealbenwiley@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"github-pull-requests","_nodeVersion":"5.12.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/github-pull-requests-0.4.3.tgz_1472576782054_0.2074040889274329"},"_npmUser":{"name":"benwiley4000","email":"therealbenwiley@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"1-acaee8eeda63a6eff27a92810cb28036","_shasum":"9353a1f6842d8784a9d619b85c48be0ee4c3414a","author":{"name":"Ben Wiley"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/benwiley4000/github-pull-requests/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.4.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"9353a1f6842d8784a9d619b85c48be0ee4c3414a","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/github-pull-requests/-/github-pull-requests-0.4.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"benwiley4000","email":"therealbenwiley@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-08-30T17:06:23.572Z","created":"2016-08-29T19:51:11.529Z","0.1.0":"2016-08-29T19:51:11.529Z","0.2.0":"2016-08-29T19:56:42.701Z","0.3.0":"2016-08-29T21:05:25.479Z","0.4.0":"2016-08-30T00:33:59.173Z","0.4.1":"2016-08-30T01:08:22.152Z","0.4.2":"2016-08-30T01:17:33.339Z","0.4.3":"2016-08-30T17:06:23.572Z"}}}
