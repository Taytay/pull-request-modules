That means that\n  your project must already have eslint installed and configured.\n- ESLint Changes will use any configuration like .eslintrc, .eslintignore,\n  plugins or other configurations that are present in the project.\n- If you don't like installing eslint-changes from Travis, you can add it\n  to your projects package.json and add only the script part to\n  .travis.yml.\n","created":"2016-10-20T18:18:51.776Z","modified":"2016-10-24T15:07:37.272Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"rileytomasek","email":"riley.tomasek@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"rileytomasek","email":"riley.tomasek@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"eslint-changes","_nodeVersion":"6.6.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/eslint-changes-0.1.2.tgz_1477321655354_0.2242848272435367"},"_npmUser":{"name":"rileytomasek","email":"riley.tomasek@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"2-47955a928a7e0abc3d4b744258b257ab","_shasum":"79568d4bd1c88c49f2dc15e2ad483d88b4b9120a","author":{"name":"Riley Tomasek"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/andofood/eslint-changes/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"79568d4bd1c88c49f2dc15e2ad483d88b4b9120a","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/eslint-changes/-/eslint-changes-0.1.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"rileytomasek","email":"riley.tomasek@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-10-24T15:07:37.272Z","created":"2016-10-20T18:18:51.776Z","0.1.0":"2016-10-20T18:18:51.776Z","0.1.1":"2016-10-20T20:55:13.272Z","0.1.2":"2016-10-24T15:07:37.272Z"}}}
