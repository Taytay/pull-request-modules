In passive mode, links to GitHub issues and GitHub pull requests are given more context. In active mode, a link to a GitHub pull request will trigger a review assignment, which will assign the right users on GitHub and notify them on both GitHub and the requesting medium (i.e. if the review request came from Slack, the reviewers will be notified there).\n\nIn order to request a review, write `review <link-to-github-pull-request-here>`:\n\n```\nalice: please review https://github.com/alice/project/pull/123\nhubot: @bob, @charlie: please review https://github.com/alice/project/pull/123\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-review --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-review** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"hubot-review\"\n]\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n`hubot-review` uses [pull-review](https://github.com/imsky/pull-review) and the GitHub GraphQL API to determine reviewer assignment. Make sure to [enable the GraphQL API for your user/organization](https://github.com/prerelease/agreement) before using `hubot-review`.\n\nSet up a `.pull-review` file in the root of your reviewed repository, and make sure to add notification information.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n## Credits\n\nMade by [Ivan Malopinsky](http://imsky.co).","starsCount":1,"created":"2017-02-25T19:05:44.401Z","modified":"2017-04-04T02:06:48.987Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"imsky","email":"hello@imsky.co"},"owners":[{"name":"imsky","email":"hello@imsky.co"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"hubot-review","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/hubot-review-0.9.12.tgz_1491271607133_0.6959023561794311"},"_npmUser":{"name":"imsky","email":"hello@imsky.co"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"14-7b3616a440c1e9e814a6f8b17f61a60a","_shasum":"e9724ddca1452b9e9d50c272ec2aed784e18cace","author":{"name":"Ivan Malopinsky"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/imsky/hubot-review/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.9.12"},"dist":{"shasum":"e9724ddca1452b9e9d50c272ec2aed784e18cace","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/hubot-review/-/hubot-review-0.9.12.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"imsky","email":"hello@imsky.co"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-04T02:06:48.987Z","created":"2017-02-25T19:05:44.401Z","0.1.0":"2017-02-25T19:05:44.401Z","0.9.0":"2017-03-01T02:11:07.360Z","0.9.1":"2017-03-01T16:03:11.221Z","0.9.2":"2017-03-01T16:43:39.267Z","0.9.4":"2017-03-02T03:20:45.489Z","0.9.5":"2017-03-02T17:31:12.980Z","0.9.6":"2017-03-03T00:43:42.562Z","0.9.7":"2017-03-03T13:55:59.414Z","0.9.8":"2017-03-05T22:04:53.686Z","0.9.9":"2017-03-07T03:16:34.894Z","0.9.10":"2017-03-10T02:34:53.807Z","0.9.11":"2017-03-20T03:01:18.973Z","0.9.12":"2017-04-04T02:06:48.987Z"},"users":{"decoded":true}}}
