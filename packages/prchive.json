Point PRchive at a project you have access to, and it'll grab all linked files and images from the project's pull requests and save them in a dir that looks like this:\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/0e0Y2J3Q2A2I1e3K1D0C/Screen%20Shot%202014-12-04%20at%205.00.07%20PM.png\">\n\nThe leading number before each filename is the PR number. PRchive also include a list of the original URLs, an HTML with images src-ing those URLs, and another page of images pointing to the local copies.\n\n## Development\n\nRun `npm run prepublish && node lib/test.js` to test the script while in development. Create a file called `.config.json` in the root to save on typing time, and fill it with your credentials like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"username\" : \"averyvery\",\n  \"password\" : \"password\",\n  \"repo\"     : \"vigetlabs/prchive\"\n}\n```\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2014-11-21T20:59:43.590Z","modified":"2015-07-09T16:30:36.099Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"averyvery","email":"doug.avery@viget.com"},"owners":[{"name":"averyvery","email":"doug.avery@viget.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"prchive","_nodeVersion":"0.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"averyvery","email":"doug.avery@viget.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.1","_rev":"1-cbc6364b4d785acc5b74ebff07e44990","_shasum":"99e64e4c41c1e3e0690298ee20dc531a0f8d3344","author":{"name":"Doug Avery","email":"doug.avery@viget.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/vigetlabs/prchive/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"99e64e4c41c1e3e0690298ee20dc531a0f8d3344","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/prchive/-/prchive-0.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"averyvery","email":"doug.avery@viget.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-07-09T16:30:36.099Z","created":"2014-11-21T20:59:43.590Z","0.0.1":"2014-11-21T20:59:43.590Z","0.0.2":"2014-11-21T21:10:14.172Z","0.0.3":"2014-11-21T21:14:16.178Z","0.0.4":"2014-12-04T05:32:16.426Z","0.1.0":"2014-12-05T00:04:19.381Z","0.1.1":"2015-07-09T16:30:36.099Z"},"users":{"jitendravyas":true}}}
