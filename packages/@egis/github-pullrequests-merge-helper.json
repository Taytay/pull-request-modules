that's why we wanted to create it in first place.\n\n## Installation\nInstall the package:\n```\nnpm install -g @egis/github-pullrequests-merge-helper\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n* Create a GitHub token to be used by github-pullrequests-merge-helper and put it to GH_TOKEN env variable.\nYou can also take (any of) GH_TOKEN created by https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release setup: it will\nprint it if you choose 'Other' CI instead of Travis.\n\n* Run it:\n```\n  github-pullrequests-merge-helper git@github.com:artemv/generator-ruby-starter-kit.git --pattern=\"Update\\s.+\\sto\\sversion\" --ci-context=\"continuous-integration\"\n```\nHere, ci-context is for Travis. Default is 'ci', that's for CircleCI. Pattern param is optional.\n\n## Limitations\nIt only shows diff for single file from single commit of the PR - just enough for semantic-dependents-updates-github and Greenkeeper use cases.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License 2016 Â© Artem Vasiliev\n\n\n[nodei.co]: https://nodei.co/npm/@egis/github-pullrequests-merge-helper.png\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/@egis/github-pullrequests-merge-helper\n","created":"2016-04-07T07:05:41.568Z","modified":"2016-04-09T17:05:39.567Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"egis-moshe","email":"moshe@egis-software.com"},"owners":[{"name":"egis-moshe","email":"moshe@egis-software.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"@egis/github-pullrequests-merge-helper","_nodeVersion":"5.7.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/github-pullrequests-merge-helper-1.0.10.tgz_1460221537249_0.11946249520406127"},"_npmUser":{"name":"egis-moshe","email":"moshe@egis-software.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.6.0","_rev":"1-2c1b66e346ced73facab87de07a2004e","_shasum":"e2c24418769644bb9e642608dcd2e09c8c2052dc","author":{"name":"Artem Vasiliev","email":"artem.job@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/artemv/github-pullrequests-merge-helper/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.10"},"dist":{"shasum":"e2c24418769644bb9e642608dcd2e09c8c2052dc","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/@egis/github-pullrequests-merge-helper/-/github-pullrequests-merge-helper-1.0.10.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"egis-moshe","email":"moshe@egis-software.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-04-09T17:05:39.567Z","created":"2016-04-07T07:05:41.568Z","0.0.1":"2016-04-07T07:05:41.568Z","0.1.0":"2016-04-07T19:20:56.322Z","0.2.0":"2016-04-07T20:17:53.626Z","0.3.0":"2016-04-07T22:11:14.504Z","0.4.0":"2016-04-07T23:08:06.114Z","0.5.0":"2016-04-07T23:16:47.140Z","0.6.0":"2016-04-07T23:25:39.710Z","1.0.0":"2016-04-07T23:26:38.251Z","1.0.1":"2016-04-07T23:32:02.676Z","1.0.2":"2016-04-07T23:42:00.315Z","1.0.3":"2016-04-07T23:49:24.882Z","1.0.4":"2016-04-07T23:58:12.564Z","1.0.5":"2016-04-08T07:58:43.173Z","1.0.6":"2016-04-08T08:14:39.762Z","1.0.7":"2016-04-08T08:30:38.102Z","1.0.8":"2016-04-08T08:31:44.911Z","1.0.9":"2016-04-08T08:46:33.625Z","1.0.10":"2016-04-09T17:05:39.567Z"}}}
