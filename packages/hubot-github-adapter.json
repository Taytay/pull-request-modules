Sign up for a new account on [Github](https://github.com/)\n2. If you have private repositories that your bot will be interacting with, [add your bot as a collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/) to all of the repositories you want it to listen and respond to. You can skip this step for public repos.\n3. [Create a new OAuth token for this Github User](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/). It needs the following scopes:\n\n- repo (If you want it to create comments on private repos it has access to)\n- public_repo (so that it can create comments on public repos)\n\n(Keep this token as secret as you would a password.)\n\n####Create a Github Webhook for your each of your repositories:\nYou'll need to create a Github webhook for every repository you want Hubot to listen to.\n\n1. Create a new webhook for your `myuser/myrepo` repository at:\n   https://github.com/myuser/myrepo/settings/hooks/new\n   Set the webhook url to: &lt;HUBOT_URL&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/hubot/github-repo-listener\n\n   For example, if your hubot lives at myhubot.herokuapp.com, then you will set the webhook URL to: http://myhubot.herokuapp.com/hubot/github-repo-listener\n\n   All of your repositories will point to the same URL.\n\n####Configure your Hubot\n\nSet the `HUBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to the token you created above.\n\nLet's say you gave your Hubot user the name \"BestHubotEver\"\nYou'll want to start your hubot with that name:\n\n- `HUBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=some-long-guid-number ./bin/hubot --adapter github-adapter --name BestHubotEver`\n\n####Test Your Hubot\n\nHubot is now listening to your comments on issues and pull requests.\nYou should be able to say:\n`@BestHubotEver ping`, and if he is listening, he will respond with `PONG`\n\n#### Testing your bot locally\n\nIf you want to test your bot locally, you can create a temporary webhook that goes to your machine instead of a live Hubot. See detailed instructions on the [hubot-github-webhook-listener](hubot-github-webhook-listener) page.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis adapter uses the following environment variables:\n\n - `HUBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` - This is the auth token for the Github user you created above.\n\n## A note on naming\n\nIt's customary to name adapters simply `hubot-<adapter>`, however `github-hubot` is taken.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright &copy; [YouNeedABudget.com](http://youneedabudget.com), LLC.
