You can\nfind instructions to do so on [Github's website](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/).\nYou will need your hubot to be reachable from the outside world for this\nto work. GithubBot is listening on `/hubot/github-events`. Currently\nthe following notifications are available:\n\n* Pull Request Assignment (please ensure the webhook sends pull request events for this to work)\n\nNote: in order for direct messages (notifications) to work GithubBot attempts to\nfuzzy match the github name or github login to someone on your team. It\nhas been tested primarily on the [Hubot Slack adapter](https://github.com/slackhq/hubot-slack), but it should work\nelsewhere. If GithubBot cannot find a matching user it drops the\nnotification and logs the failure to the console.\n","created":"2015-09-29T14:05:22.330Z","modified":"2017-03-10T15:55:29.674Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ndaversa","email":"nino@ndaversa.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ndaversa","email":"nino@ndaversa.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"hubot-github-bot","_nodeVersion":"6.3.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/hubot-github-bot-4.0.4.tgz_1489161327855_0.8172490037977695"},"_npmUser":{"name":"ndaversa","email":"nino@ndaversa.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"6-be20b6f9557009f4a100f55a3b7bdb0b","_shasum":"7a4257076bc417155a481749e043e2a1ffc0d469","author":{"name":"Nino D'Aversa","email":"nino@ndaversa.com","url":"http://ndaversa.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ndaversa/hubot-github-bot/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"4.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"7a4257076bc417155a481749e043e2a1ffc0d469","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/hubot-github-bot/-/hubot-github-bot-4.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ndaversa","email":"nino@ndaversa.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-10T15:55:29.674Z","created":"2015-09-29T14:05:22.330Z","1.0.0":"2015-09-29T14:05:22.330Z","1.0.1":"2015-09-29T14:21:10.653Z","1.0.2":"2015-09-29T14:56:28.390Z","1.1.0":"2015-09-30T20:06:18.781Z","1.1.1":"2015-09-30T20:21:56.898Z","1.2.0":"2015-09-30T20:39:14.926Z","1.2.1":"2015-09-30T22:02:08.877Z","1.3.0":"2015-10-01T16:28:20.531Z","1.3.1":"2015-10-13T00:25:39.475Z","1.4.0":"2016-02-18T21:09:53.030Z","1.4.1":"2016-02-18T21:39:40.239Z","1.4.2":"2016-02-19T05:48:18.176Z","1.5.0":"2016-02-28T18:42:17.512Z","2.0.0":"2016-03-13T04:06:19.790Z","3.0.0":"2016-04-18T20:50:29.841Z","3.0.1":"2016-04-18T21:15:36.097Z","3.0.2":"2016-04-18T21:42:00.148Z","3.0.3":"2016-04-19T20:29:29.690Z","3.0.4":"2016-04-20T13:11:41.162Z","3.0.5":"2016-04-22T14:00:39.450Z","3.1.0":"2016-04-22T20:05:01.679Z","3.2.0":"2016-04-25T21:55:03.257Z","3.3.0":"2016-04-28T17:58:28.102Z","3.3.1":"2016-05-12T20:19:03.398Z","3.3.2":"2016-05-26T18:56:57.052Z","4.0.0":"2016-11-05T19:33:30.974Z","4.0.1":"2016-11-07T16:23:22.612Z","4.0.2":"2016-11-10T17:49:37.087Z","4.0.3":"2016-11-10T17:50:46.528Z","4.0.4":"2017-03-10T15:55:29.674Z"}}}
