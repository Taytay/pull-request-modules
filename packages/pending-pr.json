But we had API, client, and plugins, and lots of others.\nThat's why I created `pending-pr`, it's a small cli tool focusing only pending pull requests.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall the module with:\n\n```\n$ npm install -g pending-pr\n```\n\nCreate `.pending-pr` file with `init` command:\n\n```\n$ pending-pr init\nToken: YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN\nRepos: foo/bar baz/qux\nMembers: banyan foo bar\n24 Sep 00:55:20 - info: create /Users/banyan/tmp/pending-pr/.pending-pr\n\n$ cat .pending-pr\n{\n    \"token\": \"YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN\",\n    \"repos\": [\"foo/baz\", \"baz/qux\"],\n    \"members\": [\"banyan\", \"foo\", \"bar\"]\n}\n```\n\n* `token` is your github oauth token.\n* `repos` is that you'd like to check if they have pending PRs.\n* `members` is that you'd like to mention to them.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nCommands:\n\n    init                 Create .pending-pr config file.\n    list                 Show mergeble pull requests. Short-cut: l\n    count                Show mergeble pull requests size. Short-cut: c\n    ping                 Ping to pull request to be merged. Short-cut: p\n    open                 Browse pull request. Short-cut: o\n```\n\n## Tips\n\nWith Jenkins or cron, it can be checked whether pending PRs exists and notify regulary.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n### Running the Tests\n\n```\n$ grunt test\n```\n\n### TODO\n\n* Customizable message\n* Configurable of unmergeble keywords\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Kohei Hasegawa\nLicensed under the MIT license.\n","created":"2013-09-23T14:36:12.793Z","modified":"2014-11-28T01:50:08.326Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"banyan","email":"ameutau@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"banyan","email":"ameutau@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"pending-pr","_npmUser":{"name":"banyan","email":"ameutau@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.3","_rev":"1-e0f912f00fec5581394cbd45842e3ba0","author":{"name":"Kohei Hasegawa","email":"ameutau@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/banyan/pending-pr/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"0e2bce867b6453ce84593e8b6d13253dcc788da3","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/pending-pr/-/pending-pr-0.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"banyan","email":"ameutau@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-11-28T01:50:08.326Z","created":"2013-09-23T14:36:12.793Z","0.1.0":"2013-09-23T14:36:15.828Z","0.1.1":"2013-09-23T14:54:05.894Z","0.1.2":"2013-09-23T15:26:10.985Z","0.1.3":"2013-09-23T15:40:14.779Z","0.1.4":"2014-02-07T02:46:13.698Z","0.1.5":"2014-02-14T01:41:04.445Z","0.2.0":"2014-11-28T01:50:08.326Z"}}}
