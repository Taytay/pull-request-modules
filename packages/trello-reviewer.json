Short answer: no.\n\nLong answer: The point of this package is to keep control of your data,\nnot having to authorize third parties to read your repos or manage your Trello boards.\n\nIf you really need to automate the integration between GitHub and Trello,\nand do not want to go through the hassle of setup,\njust use [Zapier](https://zapier.com/zapbook/github/trello/)\nwhich appears to be a very nice integration service.\n\n","created":"2015-09-22T09:28:58.804Z","modified":"2015-10-09T11:56:03.439Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"alexfernandez","email":"alexfernandeznpm@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"alexfernandez","email":"alexfernandeznpm@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"trello-reviewer","_nodeVersion":"0.10.25","_npmUser":{"name":"alexfernandez","email":"alexfernandeznpm@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.7.5","_rev":"1-74a75df85c791d70964cf6f193710a58","_shasum":"0fe586363979602563faabe9b9f9e085afb8ad9b","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/alexfernandez/trello-reviewer/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Alex Fern√°ndez","email":"alexfernandeznpm@gmail.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"0fe586363979602563faabe9b9f9e085afb8ad9b","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/trello-reviewer/-/trello-reviewer-0.1.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"alexfernandez","email":"alexfernandeznpm@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-10-09T11:56:03.439Z","created":"2015-09-22T09:28:58.804Z","0.1.1":"2015-09-22T09:28:58.804Z","0.1.2":"2015-10-07T08:14:03.401Z","0.1.3":"2015-10-09T11:10:33.816Z","0.1.4":"2015-10-09T11:56:03.439Z"}}}
